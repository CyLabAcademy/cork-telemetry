# Standalone Telemetry Module

This telemetry module is for use with cmgr multi host support. It runs a simple go server that returns a json with the format {"overloaded": True/False} depending on the status of the server.
To hit the endpoint do http://<ip_OR_URL>:2136/health
By default it runs on port 2136 so make sure cmgr doesn't assign this port for a challenge! This setting is configurable
It returns overloaded when cpu or ram >90%, it doesn't go back to fine until both drop below 80%
The source code within the debug directory is for a custom debugger build that will expose more system health values and log them to stderr. By default telemetry only exposes whether or not the system is considered overloaded and does not log anything.

### Configuration

The preconfigured telemetry.service file provides telemetry as a systemd service. It defaults to port 2136 and expects the telemetry binary at /usr/local/bin/telemetry. Place the file in /etc/systemd/system/.

### Ansible Support

Eventually, we want ansible to pull an artifact from this build and then automatically install this server on the challenge workers, but that is for the future.

### HTTPS Support

If we want HTTPS support then we will have this guy serve using the docker certs as well
